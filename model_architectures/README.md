Seperate file per model, e.g. `LSTM.py` for LSTM, `GRU.py` for GRU etc.

`models.py` contains a variable `models` that is a list of these models

# Baseline.py

Contains baseline models to compare to as a sanity check: one that predicts the most recent value and one that predicts the mean of the feature vector
